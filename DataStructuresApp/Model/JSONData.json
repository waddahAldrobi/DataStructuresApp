It simplifies details of a component so that a user only needs to know the interface rather than the complicated details of its implementation. <font color=\"blue\" strokeColor=\"blue\" face=\"American Typewriter\">\n\nWhat are some examples? <font color=\"black\" strokeColor=\"black\" face=\"American Typewriter\">\n•Some ADTs you already know about are classes. For example, a person class is an ADT that attempts to model the behaviours and attributes of a person.
