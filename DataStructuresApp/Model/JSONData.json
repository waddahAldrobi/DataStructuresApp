The variables are reserved in Last In First Out (LIFO) order - the last stored block of memory is the first to be freed.</li></ul> </li> <li>Heap:</li> <li> <ul><li>stores variables in dynamic memory and access variables a bit slower. Variables stored in heap can be accessed randomly at any time. Memory in the heap is limited by virtual memory - it is often used when the data at runtime is not known.</li></ul> </li> </ul></html>",
